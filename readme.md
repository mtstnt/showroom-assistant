# Showroom Assistant

**Currently in pre-release mode**
If something went wrong/didn't work, please submit an issue (or also PR if you know how to fix it).  

For now, install from the master branch:
1. Clone master branch to local
2. Run `npm install` to install all dependencies.
3. Run `npm run build` to build the project to `dist` folder.
4. Open `chrome://extensions` and toggle Developer Mode to `ON`. 
5. Click `Load Unpacked`. Load the root folder of this project (the same level as the manifest.json file).
6. The extension is now installed.  

If you see any problem that is quite fatal (unable to load video, etc), just uninstall it and submit an issue (if you want to).
